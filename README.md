# Project-Social-Media


Project modeled on modern portals like Facebook / Twitter.

## Motvation

  - I created this project to check my knowledge gained in Laravel courses in practice
  - I wanted to plan a larger application myself without the help of courses or diffrent person.

## Technologies

 - Laravel 5
 - PHP 7
 - Bootstrap 4

## Prerequisites
 - PHP >= 7.1.3
## Setup

 -  First, download the Laravel installer using Composer:
 ```sh
    composer global require "laravel/installer=~1.1"
```
 - Start local Apache server and MySQL.
 - Use next commands in downloaded folder:
 - Run the database migrations (Set the database connection in .env file before migrating(dbname/password/username))
 ```sh
    php artisan migrate
```
 - Start the local development server
 ```sh
    php artisan serve
```
 - You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000
